## Australian Electric Vehicle Association

The Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA) LTD is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the cause of switching Australia's transport networks to electric drive as quickly as possible.  We all share a common interest in electromobility and climate-friendly transport. Formed after the oil price shocks of 1973, the AEVA is the longest continuously running EV society in the world.  

We represent all EV users and enthusiasts, current and prospective, and are more than happy to offer jargon-free advice on which EV is right for you. We also make regular submissions to government and industry about policies which will help transition to electric drive, and away from imported fossil fuels for transport.
